# BALs

   This repository contains the data from our quasar outflow works. 
   
The first paper "The ubiquitous imprint of radiative acceleration in the mean absorption spectrum of quasar outflows" 
is here: 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190204085M 
and the second one "Radiation-pressure waves and multiphase quasar outflows" here: 
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190308170M

The data is public, so please, go ahead and use it for your work, and let me know if you find 
issues or need help or have questions at lluismasribas AT gmail DOT com.


  We have made BAL_line_list accessible to everyone. 
Please, correct, extend, edit the file and commit your changes here so others can also 
benefit from it. 

  The stacked spectra are raw, i.e., they are the ones computed without any additional 
re-normalization used in the analysis.

  I have also added a few PPT slides I use to explain line locking. Feel free to use them 
if you find them useful.
